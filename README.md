# Dotfiles
Custom dotfiles I use on **Omarchy Linux**.

###  Waybar

![Waybar Preview](assets/waybar.png)
Custom Waybar setup for Hyprland, originally based on one of the styles from  [JaKooLit’s Hyprland-Dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/tree/c862835221decf03b6640bb43e4044861cceaa04/config/waybar), which I further modified for better integration with my setup.

###  Features
- **Workspaces** – Clean Hyprland icons with smooth transitions.
- **Audio** – PipeWire/ALSA volume widget with scroll actions.
- **Backlight** – Brightness control with scroll actions.
- **VPN** – Auto-detects WireGuard/OpenVPN via custom scripts.
